## Hi there 👋
I'm Chandu, a designer and devloper from India.

I design and build Interactive and Cool websites.

if an idea comes into my mind i try to turn it into practical and learn from my mistakes
and improve upon it.

I mostly work on React Js, Tailwind CSS, Nodejs {express} and Postgre.

I also use Figma for my UI design and create site map.

I am Still learning Profile many stuff and i'll be uploading smaller projects,experiments 
and things I'm currently working on.Everything here is built in scratch, no copy/templates.
